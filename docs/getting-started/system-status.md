# System Status

The [System Status](https://status.stangerup.cloud) provides you with uptime statistics and an overview of the infrastructure surrounding Stangerup Cloud. This includes server locations in both the EU and the US.

:::warning

If you're unable to access parts of our infrastructure, the System Status is the first place you should check for any downtime. While we aim to prevent downtime at all cost, we also believe it's important to be transparent with our clients in those situations.
