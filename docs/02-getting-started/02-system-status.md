# System status

The [System status](https://status.stangerup.cloud) provides you with uptime statistics and a brief overview of the infrastructure surrounding Stangerup Cloud. This includes server locations in both Europe and the United States.

- **Components** include core services to our cloud.
- **Applications** include region and project-specific services for running applications.
- **Miscellaneous** include non-critical system services such as this site.

:::warning

If you are unable to access parts of our infrastructure, the System status is the first place you should check for any downtime. While we aim to prevent downtime at all cost, we also believe it is important to be transparent with our clients in those situations.
